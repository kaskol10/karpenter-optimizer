## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or later
- Node.js 22.12+ and npm
- Docker and docker-compose (optional)
- Kubernetes cluster with Karpenter (for testing)
- kubectl configured

### Backend Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaskol10/karpenter-optimizer.git
cd karpenter-optimizer

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run the API server
go run ./cmd/api
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build individually
docker build -t karpenter-optimizer-api .
docker build -t karpenter-optimizer-frontend ./frontend
```

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` to format code
- Use `golint` or `golangci-lint` for linting
- Write meaningful comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors explicitly

### JavaScript/React Code Style

- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use ESLint for linting
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Write functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add support for multi-region pricing

Add AWS Pricing API integration for fetching prices across multiple regions.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(recommender): correct cost calculation for spot instances

Spot instance pricing was incorrectly calculated. Fixed to use 25% of on-demand price.

Fixes #456
```

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

See [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md) for the complete testing strategy and guidelines.

### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test
# or
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
# or
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/recommender/...

# Run tests with race detector
go test -race ./...
```

**Current Test Coverage:**
- ✅ `internal/config` - Configuration loading tests
- ✅ `internal/api` - API endpoint tests (health, Swagger)
- ✅ `internal/recommender` - Core recommendation logic tests
- ⬜ `internal/kubernetes` - Kubernetes client tests (needs mocks)
- ⬜ `internal/awspricing` - AWS Pricing API tests (needs mocks)
- ⬜ `internal/ollama` - Ollama client tests (needs mocks)

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

Tests use Vitest and Testing Library; see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Set up test environment
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig

# Run integration tests
go test -tags=integration ./...
```

**Note:** Integration tests are planned but not yet implemented.

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Add code comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes (create it if it doesn't exist)
- Keep inline documentation up to date
